However, my one year old likes to lift the flaps himself and I also think this is a great way for him to be part of the story too.  The problem with this book is the flaps covering the different body parts are very flimsy and very easily ruined.  Compared to some other books out there, this one doesn't live up to expectations.  Youngsters are still figuring out motor skills and are anything but delicate at this stage.

Each page asks, "Where is baby's ...?"  Toddlers delight in lifting the flaps to find the hidden pictures.  The pictures are bright and cute with eye-catching fabric and wallpaper patterns.  A very attractive book, and perfect for that stage when toddlers become fascinated with their belly buttons!  My 17 month old has really enjoyed this book.  It can be very helpful in getting kids to name body parts, and it's fun for both the baby and the parents to read.  Highly recommended.Author: mararedRating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R2EN1XAV1FADJ0Link:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EN1XAV1FADJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -Great:O, -fun:O, -for:O, -baby:O, -and:O, -parents!Text:O, -This:O, -is:O, -a:O, -nice:O, -sturdy:O, -book:O, -with:O, -colorful:O, -drawings:O, -of:O, -babies:O, -with:O, -some:O, -part:O, -of:O, -their:O, -body:O, -hidden:O, -.:O, -Each:O, -page:O, -asks:O, -,:O, -``:O, -Where:O, -is:O, -baby:O, -'s:O, -...:O, -?:O, -'':O, -Toddlers:O, -delight:O, -in:O, -lifting:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -to:O, -find:O, -the:O, -hidden:O, -pictures:O, -.:O, -The:O, -pictures:O, -are:O, -bright:O, -and:O, -cute:O, -with:O, -eye-catching:O, -fabric:O, -and:O, -wallpaper:O, -patterns:O, -.:O, -A:O, -very:O, -attractive:O, -book:O, -,:O, -and:O, -perfect:O, -for:O, -that:O, -stage:O, -when:O, -toddlers:O, -become:O, -fascinated:O, -with:O, -their:O, -belly:O, -buttons:O, -!:O, -My:O, -17:DURATION, -month:DURATION, -old:O, -has:O, -really:O, -enjoyed:O, -this:O, -book:O, -.:O, -It:O, -can:O, -be:O, -very:O, -helpful:O, -in:O, -getting:O, -kids:O, -to:O, -name:O, -body:O, -parts:O, -,:O, -and:O, -it:O, -'s:O, -fun:O, -for:O, -both:O, -the:O, -baby:O, -and:O, -the:O, -parents:O, -to:O, -read:O, -.:O, -Highly:O, -recommended.Author:O, -mararedRating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:lightgreen ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

They are the perfect book for babies! They are sturdy enough to withstand baby teeth and drool. The pictures are always bright and captivating, they definitely keep little one's attention. Out of all the Lift-the-Flap books my daughter has, her favorite might be Where is Baby's Belly Button? Every time it gets to the part to "life the flap" my daughter squeals in delight or starts trying to talk! The only thing I'd suggest is to watch out for little hands trying to rip the "flap" off. The pages are thick and nearly impossible to tear, but the "flap" can be torn off by a determined Little One. However, it's nothing a little double-sided tape can't fix.

She really enjoys turning the flaps and finding the items and then showing where the items (belly button etc.) are located on herself, her teddy bear, etc. Good value for money. She sometimes tear off a flap, and that is the only reason I do not give this item 5 stars, but the flaps are pretty easy to tape on again.

I also, obviously like that it is a lift the flap book, because they engage my son for so long. One of the reasons I chose this particular book is because it addresses body parts and I thought it would be helpful when learning those body parts.What I don't like:Quality, quality, quality! We own several board books, but this one isn't nearly as nice as many others we own and have seen. He is 19 moths at the time of writing this and we have had it for about 6 months now and it has not held up nearly as well as the other lift the flap books we own, and he plays with this one far less. He loves his books and isn't very rough with them, so this is one of the few books we have that are damaged. The pages are very thin compared to literally every other board book we own, and the flaps are extremely flimsy and got bent during the first use.Overall, we like this book, but if I could go back in time I would choose a different book. It has not been a hit for us and is a bit disappointing. I would have given it 4 stars (maybe 5) if the quality was better.Author: AshleyRating: 3<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R15ISW7QF1DTTPLink:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15ISW7QF1DTTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -Quality:O, -is:O, -very:O, -disappointingText:O, -My:O, -son:O, -really:O, -loves:O, -lift:O, -the:O, -flap:O, -style:O, -books:O, -so:O, -I:O, -decided:O, -to:O, -purchase:O, -a:O, -new:O, -one:NUMBER, -and:O, -this:O, -is:O, -a:O, -classic.What:O, -I:O, -like:O, -about:O, -it:O, -The:O, -illustrations:O, -are:O, -adorable:O, -.:O, -I:O, -also:O, -,:O, -obviously:O, -like:O, -that:O, -it:O, -is:O, -a:O, -lift:O, -the:O, -flap:O, -book:O, -,:O, -because:O, -they:O, -engage:O, -my:O, -son:O, -for:O, -so:O, -long:O, -.:O, -One:NUMBER, -of:O, -the:O, -reasons:O, -I:O, -chose:O, -this:O, -particular:O, -book:O, -is:O, -because:O, -it:O, -addresses:O, -body:O, -parts:O, -and:O, -I:O, -thought:O, -it:O, -would:O, -be:O, -helpful:O, -when:O, -learning:O, -those:O, -body:O, -parts.What:O, -I:O, -do:O, -n't:O, -like:O, -Quality:O, -,:O, -quality:O, -,:O, -quality:O, -!:O, -We:O, -own:O, -several:O, -board:O, -books:O, -,:O, -but:O, -this:O, -one:NUMBER, -is:O, -n't:O, -nearly:O, -as:O, -nice:O, -as:O, -many:O, -others:O, -we:O, -own:O, -and:O, -have:O, -seen:O, -.:O, -He:O, -is:O, -19:DURATION, -moths:O, -at:O, -the:O, -time:O, -of:O, -writing:O, -this:O, -and:O, -we:O, -have:O, -had:O, -it:O, -for:O, -about:O, -6:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -now:O, -and:O, -it:O, -has:O, -not:O, -held:O, -up:O, -nearly:O, -as:O, -well:O, -as:O, -the:O, -other:O, -lift:O, -the:O, -flap:O, -books:O, -we:O, -own:O, -,:O, -and:O, -he:O, -plays:O, -with:O, -this:O, -one:NUMBER, -far:O, -less:O, -.:O, -He:O, -loves:O, -his:O, -books:O, -and:O, -is:O, -n't:O, -very:O, -rough:O, -with:O, -them:O, -,:O, -so:O, -this:O, -is:O, -one:NUMBER, -of:O, -the:O, -few:O, -books:O, -we:O, -have:O, -that:O, -are:O, -damaged:O, -.:O, -The:O, -pages:O, -are:O, -very:O, -thin:O, -compared:O, -to:O, -literally:O, -every:O, -other:O, -board:O, -book:O, -we:O, -own:O, -,:O, -and:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -are:O, -extremely:O, -flimsy:O, -and:O, -got:O, -bent:O, -during:O, -the:O, -first:ORDINAL, -use.Overall:O, -,:O, -we:O, -like:O, -this:O, -book:O, -,:O, -but:O, -if:O, -I:O, -could:O, -go:O, -back:O, -in:O, -time:O, -I:O, -would:O, -choose:O, -a:O, -different:O, -book:O, -.:O, -It:O, -has:O, -not:O, -been:O, -a:O, -hit:O, -for:O, -us:O, -and:O, -is:O, -a:O, -bit:O, -disappointing:O, -.:O, -I:O, -would:O, -have:O, -given:O, -it:O, -4:NUMBER, -stars:O, --LRB-:O, -maybe:O, -5:O, --RRB-:O, -if:O, -the:O, -quality:O, -was:O, -better.Author:O, -AshleyRating:O, -3:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:lightgreen ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

The color choices on each page is like a work of art. Of all the books this has been the most beautiful to look at, and both I and my son have enjoyed this book for two months now. So why four stars? The flaps are very, very thin. For this kind of a book the construction is of very poor quality and of all the lift-the-flap books my son has, this has been the most poorly made and deserves only one star. However, because I like the images of this book I still give it four stars. But one of the flaps is long gone. I purchased this together with "Dear Zoo" and in comparison between the two books is like night and day. "Dear Zoo" has held up very nicely (also much beloved by my son) because the flaps are made of carton-like paper. But "Where Is Baby's Belly Button" uses thin paper for the flaps. I hope the publishers correct this design flaw. If yes, then I'll very happily purchase it again for future baby #2 :)Author: S.S.Rating: 4<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R27I1YAPZH764FLink:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27I1YAPZH764F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -This:O, -book:O, -is:O, -just:O, -very:O, -beautiful:O, -,:O, -cuteText:O, -This:O, -book:O, -is:O, -just:O, -very:O, -beautiful:O, -,:O, -cute:O, -,:O, -smart:O, -,:O, -and:O, -overall:O, -just:O, -adorable:O, -.:O, -The:O, -color:O, -choices:O, -on:O, -each:O, -page:O, -is:O, -like:O, -a:O, -work:O, -of:O, -art:O, -.:O, -Of:O, -all:O, -the:O, -books:O, -this:O, -has:O, -been:O, -the:O, -most:O, -beautiful:O, -to:O, -look:O, -at:O, -,:O, -and:O, -both:O, -I:O, -and:O, -my:O, -son:O, -have:O, -enjoyed:O, -this:O, -book:O, -for:O, -two:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -now:O, -.:O, -So:O, -why:O, -four:NUMBER, -stars:O, -?:O, -The:O, -flaps:O, -are:O, -very:O, -,:O, -very:O, -thin:O, -.:O, -For:O, -this:O, -kind:O, -of:O, -a:O, -book:O, -the:O, -construction:O, -is:O, -of:O, -very:O, -poor:O, -quality:O, -and:O, -of:O, -all:O, -the:O, -lift-the-flap:O, -books:O, -my:O, -son:O, -has:O, -,:O, -this:O, -has:O, -been:O, -the:O, -most:O, -poorly:O, -made:O, -and:O, -deserves:O, -only:O, -one:NUMBER, -star:O, -.:O, -However:O, -,:O, -because:O, -I:O, -like:O, -the:O, -images:O, -of:O, -this:O, -book:O, -I:O, -still:O, -give:O, -it:O, -four:NUMBER, -stars:O, -.:O, -But:O, -one:NUMBER, -of:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -is:O, -long:O, -gone:O, -.:O, -I:O, -purchased:O, -this:O, -together:O, -with:O, -``:O, -Dear:O, -Zoo:O, -'':O, -and:O, -in:O, -comparison:O, -between:O, -the:O, -two:NUMBER, -books:O, -is:O, -like:O, -night:TIME, -and:O, -day:TIME, -.:O, -``:O, -Dear:O, -Zoo:O, -'':O, -has:O, -held:O, -up:O, -very:O, -nicely:O, --LRB-:O, -also:O, -much:O, -beloved:O, -by:O, -my:O, -son:O, --RRB-:O, -because:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -are:O, -made:O, -of:O, -carton-like:O, -paper:O, -.:O, -But:O, -``:O, -Where:O, -Is:O, -Baby:O, -'s:O, -Belly:O, -Button:O, -'':O, -uses:O, -thin:O, -paper:O, -for:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -.:O, -I:O, -hope:O, -the:O, -publishers:O, -correct:O, -this:O, -design:O, -flaw:O, -.:O, -If:O, -yes:O, -,:O, -then:O, -I:O, -'ll:O, -very:O, -happily:O, -purchase:O, -it:O, -again:O, -for:O, -future:O, -baby:O, -#:MONEY, -2:MONEY, --RRB-:O, -Author:TITLE, -S.S.Rating:O, -4:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:red ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

Although it isn't very long, it is just the right length for babies and younger children. Colorful images and the fun lift-the-flap pages had our baby (and even her 4 year old big sister) giggling along in no time. The book is just the right size to hold in your hands while holding your little one. The only draw back is making sure the flaps don't get torn. My baby was immediately tugging and pulling on the flaps and with the right amount of force, it would tear right off. Even with that concern though, I still would recommend this book!Author: pmdonnellyRating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R3PIU8RR2V1QXRLink:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PIU8RR2V1QXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -Had:O, -my:O, -11:DURATION, -month:DURATION, -old:O, -laughing:O, -and:O, -playing:O, -along!Text:O, -I:O, -bought:O, -this:O, -book:O, -for:O, -my:O, -11:DURATION, -month:DURATION, -old:O, -daughter:O, -for:O, -Christmas:O, -this:O, -year:O, -and:O, -I:O, -'m:O, -so:O, -glad:O, -I:O, -did:O, -.:O, -Although:O, -it:O, -is:O, -n't:O, -very:O, -long:O, -,:O, -it:O, -is:O, -just:O, -the:O, -right:O, -length:O, -for:O, -babies:O, -and:O, -younger:O, -children:O, -.:O, -Colorful:O, -images:O, -and:O, -the:O, -fun:O, -lift-the-flap:O, -pages:O, -had:O, -our:O, -baby:O, --LRB-:O, -and:O, -even:O, -her:O, -4:DURATION, -year:DURATION, -old:O, -big:O, -sister:O, --RRB-:O, -giggling:O, -along:O, -in:O, -no:O, -time:O, -.:O, -The:O, -book:O, -is:O, -just:O, -the:O, -right:O, -size:O, -to:O, -hold:O, -in:O, -your:O, -hands:O, -while:O, -holding:O, -your:O, -little:O, -one:NUMBER, -.:O, -The:O, -only:O, -draw:O, -back:O, -is:O, -making:O, -sure:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -do:O, -n't:O, -get:O, -torn:O, -.:O, -My:O, -baby:O, -was:O, -immediately:O, -tugging:O, -and:O, -pulling:O, -on:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -and:O, -with:O, -the:O, -right:O, -amount:O, -of:O, -force:O, -,:O, -it:O, -would:O, -tear:O, -right:O, -off:O, -.:O, -Even:O, -with:O, -that:O, -concern:O, -though:O, -,:O, -I:O, -still:O, -would:O, -recommend:O, -this:O, -book!Author:O, -pmdonnellyRating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:red ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

This was the first book he actually loved and engaged with. We read through this book with him daily. He quickly grasped the concept of "Where is ..." and was excited when the flaps where lifted to reveal the item. I noticed that he also quickly translated it to things in his surroundings. When asked where is Dada etc, he would look in the direction of the person or item long before "they", meaning the experts, said he should. He is now 13 months old and still loves the book. Ever since he could walk and multitask, it surprised us that he would take this book up and walk to either his Dad or me so we could read it to him. Needless to say, it's pretty worn at this stage. If there is a less than positive remark I can make is that, although it's a board book, my little guy found a way to rip most of the flaps off. There is tape on every page :-) Not so sure if they could make it any sturdier though. Love this book!!! Definitely get it for your little one.Author: kytuh utytgyuhRating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R3QKCZV42H5JEILink:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QKCZV42H5JEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -A:O, -must:O, -buy!Text:O, -I:O, -got:O, -this:O, -book:O, -for:O, -my:O, -then:O, -5:DURATION, -month:DURATION, -old:O, -infant:O, -and:O, -he:O, -was:O, -fascinated:O, -with:O, -the:O, -concept:O, -of:O, -things:O, -concealed:O, -.:O, -This:O, -was:O, -the:O, -first:ORDINAL, -book:O, -he:O, -actually:O, -loved:O, -and:O, -engaged:O, -with:O, -.:O, -We:O, -read:O, -through:O, -this:O, -book:O, -with:O, -him:O, -daily:O, -.:O, -He:O, -quickly:O, -grasped:O, -the:O, -concept:O, -of:O, -``:O, -Where:O, -is:O, -...:O, -'':O, -and:O, -was:O, -excited:O, -when:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -where:O, -lifted:O, -to:O, -reveal:O, -the:O, -item:O, -.:O, -I:O, -noticed:O, -that:O, -he:O, -also:O, -quickly:O, -translated:O, -it:O, -to:O, -things:O, -in:O, -his:O, -surroundings:O, -.:O, -When:O, -asked:O, -where:O, -is:O, -Dada:PERSON, -etc:O, -,:O, -he:O, -would:O, -look:O, -in:O, -the:O, -direction:O, -of:O, -the:O, -person:O, -or:O, -item:O, -long:O, -before:O, -``:O, -they:O, -'':O, -,:O, -meaning:O, -the:O, -experts:O, -,:O, -said:O, -he:O, -should:O, -.:O, -He:O, -is:O, -now:O, -13:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -old:O, -and:O, -still:O, -loves:O, -the:O, -book:O, -.:O, -Ever:O, -since:O, -he:O, -could:O, -walk:O, -and:O, -multitask:O, -,:O, -it:O, -surprised:O, -us:O, -that:O, -he:O, -would:O, -take:O, -this:O, -book:O, -up:O, -and:O, -walk:O, -to:O, -either:O, -his:O, -Dad:O, -or:O, -me:O, -so:O, -we:O, -could:O, -read:O, -it:O, -to:O, -him:O, -.:O, -Needless:O, -to:O, -say:O, -,:O, -it:O, -'s:O, -pretty:O, -worn:O, -at:O, -this:O, -stage:O, -.:O, -If:O, -there:O, -is:O, -a:O, -less:O, -than:O, -positive:O, -remark:O, -I:O, -can:O, -make:O, -is:O, -that:O, -,:O, -although:O, -it:O, -'s:O, -a:O, -board:O, -book:O, -,:O, -my:O, -little:O, -guy:O, -found:O, -a:O, -way:O, -to:O, -rip:O, -most:O, -of:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -off:O, -.:O, -There:O, -is:O, -tape:O, -on:O, -every:O, -page:O, -:--RRB-:O, -Not:O, -so:O, -sure:O, -if:O, -they:O, -could:O, -make:O, -it:O, -any:O, -sturdier:O, -though:O, -.:O, -Love:O, -this:O, -book:O, -!!!:O, -Definitely:O, -get:O, -it:O, -for:O, -your:O, -little:O, -one.Author:O, -kytuh:O, -utytgyuhRating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:red ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

This is not a board book so we didn't pull it out for her much until around 8 months when she stopped teething on the flaps.  Even at about 8 months she was really good at lifting the flaps herself and now at 10 months she is starting to associate the body parts in the book with her body parts.  We always touch her foot, hand, etc when we find that part in the book.  The other day she lifted her own shirt to find her belly button which was cute but also shows us that she is learning.  We used clear packaging tape to mend a tear from an excited baby lifting a flap too hard and it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to do that to all of the flaps to make this book last.Author: mecRating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R3MIC1REUBPREZLink:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MIC1REUBPREZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -One:DURATION, -of:O, -my:O, -ten:DURATION, -month:DURATION, -old:O, -'s:O, -favorite:O, -booksText:O, -We:O, -got:O, -this:O, -for:O, -my:O, -baby:O, -at:O, -around:O, -6:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -and:O, -she:O, -loved:O, -it:O, -then:O, -but:O, -constantly:O, -wanted:O, -to:O, -eat:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -.:O, -This:O, -is:O, -not:O, -a:O, -board:O, -book:O, -so:O, -we:O, -did:O, -n't:O, -pull:O, -it:O, -out:O, -for:O, -her:O, -much:O, -until:O, -around:O, -8:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -when:O, -she:O, -stopped:O, -teething:O, -on:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -.:O, -Even:O, -at:O, -about:O, -8:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -she:O, -was:O, -really:O, -good:O, -at:O, -lifting:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -herself:O, -and:O, -now:O, -at:O, -10:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -she:O, -is:O, -starting:O, -to:O, -associate:O, -the:O, -body:O, -parts:O, -in:O, -the:O, -book:O, -with:O, -her:O, -body:O, -parts:O, -.:O, -We:O, -always:O, -touch:O, -her:O, -foot:O, -,:O, -hand:O, -,:O, -etc:O, -when:O, -we:O, -find:O, -that:O, -part:O, -in:O, -the:O, -book:O, -.:O, -The:O, -other:O, -day:TIME, -she:O, -lifted:O, -her:O, -own:O, -shirt:O, -to:O, -find:O, -her:O, -belly:O, -button:O, -which:O, -was:O, -cute:O, -but:O, -also:O, -shows:O, -us:O, -that:O, -she:O, -is:O, -learning:O, -.:O, -We:O, -used:O, -clear:O, -packaging:O, -tape:O, -to:O, -mend:O, -a:O, -tear:O, -from:O, -an:O, -excited:O, -baby:O, -lifting:O, -a:O, -flap:O, -too:O, -hard:O, -and:O, -it:O, -probably:O, -would:O, -n't:O, -be:O, -a:O, -bad:O, -idea:O, -to:O, -do:O, -that:O, -to:O, -all:O, -of:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -to:O, -make:O, -this:O, -book:O, -last.Author:O, -mecRating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:lightgreen ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

At first, I read it to her and lifted the flaps, but now she lifts the flaps as I read it to her. Many times I've had to read this book three times in a row!The flaps on this book are more durable than some. They've become bent from much use but are still hanging on. Baby has ripped off lesser flaps.After reading this book to my baby for months, I recently caught my 10 month old flipping through the pages on her own saying "baby" as she lifted the flaps. I read one of the pages to her  as she sat there and she immediately climbed into my lap to have the book finished.Author: K.

The words are so simple, perfect for babies. My baby started lifting flaps around 11 months and this book was right up his alley. He read it every night. He loved to flip all the flaps and then touch the face of the baby hiding behind the flap, and when he got to the last page, he would always smile when he found the hiding baby. The only trouble with this book is that the flaps tear off easily. We've had to glue some flaps back already.Author: TZRating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R31DYT53JJ16KJLink:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31DYT53JJ16KJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -Baby:O, -loves:O, -this:O, -bookText:O, -A:O, -great:O, -little:O, -lift-the-flap:O, -book:O, -.:O, -The:O, -words:O, -are:O, -so:O, -simple:O, -,:O, -perfect:O, -for:O, -babies:O, -.:O, -My:O, -baby:O, -started:O, -lifting:O, -flaps:O, -around:O, -11:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -and:O, -this:O, -book:O, -was:O, -right:O, -up:O, -his:O, -alley:O, -.:O, -He:O, -read:O, -it:O, -every:O, -night:TIME, -.:O, -He:O, -loved:O, -to:O, -flip:O, -all:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -and:O, -then:O, -touch:O, -the:O, -face:O, -of:O, -the:O, -baby:O, -hiding:O, -behind:O, -the:O, -flap:O, -,:O, -and:O, -when:O, -he:O, -got:O, -to:O, -the:O, -last:O, -page:O, -,:O, -he:O, -would:O, -always:O, -smile:O, -when:O, -he:O, -found:O, -the:O, -hiding:O, -baby:O, -.:O, -The:O, -only:O, -trouble:O, -with:O, -this:O, -book:O, -is:O, -that:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -tear:O, -off:O, -easily:O, -.:O, -We:O, -'ve:O, -had:O, -to:O, -glue:O, -some:O, -flaps:O, -back:O, -already.Author:O, -TZRating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:lightgreen ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

Eventually between 7-9 months, after reading the reviews here, I ordered this. And voila! He seemed to like it -- well, he would at least sit still on my lap long enough to turn the pages and lift the flaps!  Three months later, it is definitely his favorite book -- he giggles when I pull it out, and loves to lift the flaps up and down, and up and down, and up and down.  After three months of all that upping and downing the flaps ARE raggedy and curled up, but he doesn't seem to mind. I figure on buying it again when it really gets worn.  I would definitely recommend this if you are trying to get a younger, active baby interested in books.Author: LyndaRating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R1H00LVI098GS0Link:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H00LVI098GS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -Great:O, -first:ORDINAL, -bookText:O, -I:O, -bought:O, -countless:O, -books:O, -before:O, -my:O, -baby:O, -was:O, -born:O, -,:O, -including:O, -most:O, -of:O, -the:O, -classics:O, -,:O, -and:O, -from:O, -about:O, -6:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -on:O, -,:O, -tried:O, -to:O, -get:O, -him:O, -interested:O, -in:O, -any:O, -and:O, -all:O, -of:O, -them:O, -with:O, -no:O, -success:O, -.:O, -Eventually:O, -between:O, -7-9:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -,:O, -after:O, -reading:O, -the:O, -reviews:O, -here:O, -,:O, -I:O, -ordered:O, -this:O, -.:O, -And:O, -voila:O, -!:O, -He:O, -seemed:O, -to:O, -like:O, -it:O, ---:O, -well:O, -,:O, -he:O, -would:O, -at:O, -least:O, -sit:O, -still:O, -on:O, -my:O, -lap:O, -long:O, -enough:O, -to:O, -turn:O, -the:O, -pages:O, -and:O, -lift:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -!:O, -Three:NUMBER, -months:DURATION, -later:O, -,:O, -it:O, -is:O, -definitely:O, -his:O, -favorite:O, -book:O, ---:O, -he:O, -giggles:O, -when:O, -I:O, -pull:O, -it:O, -out:O, -,:O, -and:O, -loves:O, -to:O, -lift:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -up:O, -and:O, -down:O, -,:O, -and:O, -up:O, -and:O, -down:O, -,:O, -and:O, -up:O, -and:O, -down:O, -.:O, -After:O, -three:DURATION, -months:DURATION, -of:O, -all:O, -that:O, -upping:O, -and:O, -downing:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -ARE:O, -raggedy:O, -and:O, -curled:O, -up:O, -,:O, -but:O, -he:O, -does:O, -n't:O, -seem:O, -to:O, -mind:O, -.:O, -I:O, -figure:O, -on:O, -buying:O, -it:O, -again:O, -when:O, -it:O, -really:O, -gets:O, -worn:O, -.:O, -I:O, -would:O, -definitely:O, -recommend:O, -this:O, -if:O, -you:O, -are:O, -trying:O, -to:O, -get:O, -a:O, -younger:O, -,:O, -active:O, -baby:O, -interested:O, -in:O, -books.Author:O, -LyndaRating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:black ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

She squeals with delight as soon as I pick it up because she knows what's coming. I read Katz's Counting Kisses to her every night and we also have Daddy Hugs. The illustrations in those two are also engaging. But nothing delights her as much as the lift the flap aspect of this book.It's especially intriguing how she "reads" the last lift a flap. I point out the bear, ball, and wagon and I say "but where's baby, where could he be?" Then I lift the flap to reveal the baby, my daughter squeals, claps and smiles big and then thoughtfully looks back over at the bear, ball and wagon and then back at the revealed baby. It's like she knows the entire scene has changed by the revealing of the baby. How can a parent not love a book that elicits such engaged thoughtful behavior?I'd recommend it highly for babies from the peekaboo stage to the learning body parts stage.Author: janiajaniaRating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R2AZ2TDKPLVYC7Link:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AZ2TDKPLVYC7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -My:O, -nine:DURATION, -month:DURATION, -old:O, -loves:O, -it!Text:O, -Oh:O, -,:O, -how:O, -my:O, -baby:O, -loves:O, -this:O, -book:O, -!:O, -She:O, -squeals:O, -with:O, -delight:O, -as:O, -soon:O, -as:O, -I:O, -pick:O, -it:O, -up:O, -because:O, -she:O, -knows:O, -what:O, -'s:O, -coming:O, -.:O, -I:O, -read:O, -Katz:PERSON, -'s:O, -Counting:O, -Kisses:O, -to:O, -her:O, -every:O, -night:TIME, -and:O, -we:O, -also:O, -have:O, -Daddy:O, -Hugs:O, -.:O, -The:O, -illustrations:O, -in:O, -those:O, -two:NUMBER, -are:O, -also:O, -engaging:O, -.:O, -But:O, -nothing:O, -delights:O, -her:O, -as:O, -much:O, -as:O, -the:O, -lift:O, -the:O, -flap:O, -aspect:O, -of:O, -this:O, -book.It:O, -'s:O, -especially:O, -intriguing:O, -how:O, -she:O, -``:O, -reads:O, -'':O, -the:O, -last:O, -lift:O, -a:O, -flap:O, -.:O, -I:O, -point:O, -out:O, -the:O, -bear:O, -,:O, -ball:O, -,:O, -and:O, -wagon:O, -and:O, -I:O, -say:O, -``:O, -but:O, -where:O, -'s:O, -baby:O, -,:O, -where:O, -could:O, -he:O, -be:O, -?:O, -'':O, -Then:O, -I:O, -lift:O, -the:O, -flap:O, -to:O, -reveal:O, -the:O, -baby:O, -,:O, -my:O, -daughter:O, -squeals:O, -,:O, -claps:O, -and:O, -smiles:O, -big:O, -and:O, -then:O, -thoughtfully:O, -looks:O, -back:O, -over:O, -at:O, -the:O, -bear:O, -,:O, -ball:O, -and:O, -wagon:O, -and:O, -then:O, -back:O, -at:O, -the:O, -revealed:O, -baby:O, -.:O, -It:O, -'s:O, -like:O, -she:O, -knows:O, -the:O, -entire:O, -scene:O, -has:O, -changed:O, -by:O, -the:O, -revealing:O, -of:O, -the:O, -baby:O, -.:O, -How:O, -can:O, -a:O, -parent:O, -not:O, -love:O, -a:O, -book:O, -that:O, -elicits:O, -such:O, -engaged:O, -thoughtful:O, -behavior?I:O, -'d:O, -recommend:O, -it:O, -highly:O, -for:O, -babies:O, -from:O, -the:O, -peekaboo:O, -stage:O, -to:O, -the:O, -learning:O, -body:O, -parts:O, -stage.Author:O, -janiajaniaRating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:lightgreen ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she's just now really starting to get into it and loves it. (Age is almost 2 years old) It's so cute. The size is perfect for setting on her lap while reading. It has various pages of different lift up or lift down, things to do. Where is baby's hands, where is baby's belly button, where is baby's feet, etc. Is also a great learning tool for those just now learning about where not only there own body parts are but as well as others. You can read aloud and ask where is baby's hands? And she lifts the fold to discover where baby's hands are. Colors are bright and vibrant. Book is sturdy and hard back as well as the pages. Easily wipeable which is a plus cause when my daughter gets into pens or markers she likes to stray away from her coloring paper to the closest thing bedside her and if this book is there then it's victim of her coloring, spilling liquids or transfer of food from her hands. Easy to read pages. Easy to lift tabs and are big enough for little fingers. Very durable book. Has been dropped, throw and sat on multiple times and doesn't even have 1 endention. Am considering buying some of the other books that go along with this one. Shipping was fast. Product was as seller described.

She is learning body parts so finding the body parts on the babies in the book, and then on her, has become such a fun learning game. Having the extra fun of lifting up the flaps on the book has just made it all the better for her.It's a simple easy read that holds her attention long enough. I bought another book at the same time Are You My Mother? (Bright & Early Board Books(TM)) that absolutely has not held her attention. It is a classic book, but seems to be too wordy and advanced for her right now. Where Is Baby's Belly Button is just perfect for her attention span at the moment.Author: PATOLARating: 5<p>[-ID:STATE_OR_PROVINCE, -R1RG5TN164JGW2Link:O, -https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RG5TN164JGW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604Title:O, -Holds:O, -Baby:O, -'s:O, -Attention:O, -And:O, -Is:O, -A:O, -Fun:O, -Way:O, -To:O, -LearnText:O, -My:O, -16:DURATION, -month:DURATION, -old:O, -granddaughter:O, -LOVES:O, -this:O, -book:O, -.:O, -She:O, -is:O, -learning:O, -body:O, -parts:O, -so:O, -finding:O, -the:O, -body:O, -parts:O, -on:O, -the:O, -babies:O, -in:O, -the:O, -book:O, -,:O, -and:O, -then:O, -on:O, -her:O, -,:O, -has:O, -become:O, -such:O, -a:O, -fun:O, -learning:O, -game:O, -.:O, -Having:O, -the:O, -extra:O, -fun:O, -of:O, -lifting:O, -up:O, -the:O, -flaps:O, -on:O, -the:O, -book:O, -has:O, -just:O, -made:O, -it:O, -all:O, -the:O, -better:O, -for:O, -her.It:O, -'s:O, -a:O, -simple:O, -easy:O, -read:O, -that:O, -holds:O, -her:O, -attention:O, -long:O, -enough:O, -.:O, -I:O, -bought:O, -another:O, -book:O, -at:O, -the:O, -same:O, -time:O, -Are:O, -You:O, -My:O, -Mother:O, -?:O, --LRB-:O, -Bright:O, -&:O, -Early:O, -Board:O, -Books:O, --LRB-:O, -TM:MISC, --RRB-:O, --RRB-:O, -that:O, -absolutely:O, -has:O, -not:O, -held:O, -her:O, -attention:O, -.:O, -It:O, -is:O, -a:O, -classic:O, -book:O, -,:O, -but:O, -seems:O, -to:O, -be:O, -too:O, -wordy:O, -and:O, -advanced:O, -for:O, -her:O, -right:O, -now:O, -.:O, -Where:O, -Is:O, -Baby:O, -'s:O, -Belly:O, -Button:O, -is:O, -just:O, -perfect:O, -for:O, -her:O, -attention:O, -span:O, -at:O, -the:O, -moment.Author:O, -PATOLARating:O, -5:NUMBER]</p></div><div style=background-color:red ><h4> Name: Where Is Baby's Belly Button?

The flaps are so big, that they get bent really easily.  The story is very simple indicating it is meant for young children, but making the flaps so big indicates the publisher does not really understand the behavior of young children. Both of our books have bent flaps and I keep these books on a high shelf where he can't get the books on his own. Imagine if these books were with his others that he has complete access to!
